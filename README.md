# Text_Classification-using-nltk
# a start to sentiment analysis

Following program classifies the words present in the movie reviews as positive and negative which further helps in sentiment analysis. We have classified the binary classes as positive and negative using NaiveBayes classifiers and have found that Bernoulli-NaiveBayes classifier comes up with the best accuracy. This is a basic stuff which gives start to in the field of NLP. We can also observe how "nltk" helps to preprocess the data for NLP tasks.

Nowadays, NLP with Deep Learning approaches have given a twist in solving real life problems with high accurate results. Various  tasks like sentiment_analysis, fake-news_classification etc. are few examples of problems that can be solved effectively using the combination of DL+NLP.
